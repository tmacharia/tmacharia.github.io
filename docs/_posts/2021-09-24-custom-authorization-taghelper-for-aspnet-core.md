Tag helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.

**What Tag Helpers provide**
* An HTML-friendly development experience.
* A rich IntelliSense environment for creating HTML and Razor markup.
* A way to make you more productive and able to produce more robust, reliable, and maintainable code using information only available on the server.

{
    <button role="button">Approve</button>
}
```
