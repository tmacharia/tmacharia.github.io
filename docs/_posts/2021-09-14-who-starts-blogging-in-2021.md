Who starts blogging in 2021? 

"It’s a reasonable question: who starts blogging in 2021? After all, it’s an old fashioned writing form..."

This question caught my attention & challenged me after coming across it posed by [Cathy O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Neil) in her introductory blog post at [mathbabe.org](https://mathbabe.org/). She is a mathematician, data scientist, former professor, and former WallStreet quant at the well known hedge fund [D.E Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Shaw_%26_Co.), she's authored a couple of books. [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction) etc. 
Her work & insights gave me the courage to kickstart a blog of my own no matter how small.

Starting a blog has been on my mind for a couple of years now, but I always talked myself out of doing it. At the end of that period, I decided to face the real reasons that kept me from that taking that leap of faith and just doing it. Here are my reasons:

1. Fear of failure
2. Vulnerability
3. Critics

Well, here's my honest attempt at blogging.
