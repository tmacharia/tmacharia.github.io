### 6. Commit: The Nuna Story, pg 69
> **Jini Kim** *Cofounder and CEO*

When we still had no orders in year two, I knew it was time to get an education. What did meaningful innovation look like in the health care market? I put on a suit and crashed some human resources conferences to find out.

To inspire true commitment, leaders must practise what they teach. They must model the behaviour they expect of others.

By definition, startups wrestle with ambiguity. Therefore, the whole team needs sharper focus and clearer priorities, the prerequisites for deeper commitment.

Most of all, we want the Nuna platform to play a big role in improving the nation's health care. It's a daunting commitment. But as I learned at Google: The hairier the mission, the more important your OKRs.

### 7. Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork, pg 77
> We don't hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.
> &mdash; <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

According to the *Harvard Business Review*, companies with highly aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top performers.

.. And it's really hard for employees to see what they should work on first. Everything seems important; everything seems urgent. But what *really* needs to get done? The answer lies in focused, transparent OKRs. They knit each individual's work to team efforts, departmental projects, and the overall mission.

For the org chart in pg. 84, Now, what's wrong with this picture? Here's a clue. The SVPs key results are a mess. Unlike the head coach's KRs, they're unmeasurable. They're not specific or time bound.
When objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects:
* *A loss of agility*
* *A lack of flexibility*
* *Marginalized contributors*
* *One-dimensional linkages*

Fortunately, there's an alternative, **Bottoms Up!**. The antithesis of cascading might be Google's "20 percent time", which frees engineers to work on side projects for the equivalent of one day per week.
People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there.
**Cross-functional Coordination**

### 8. Align: The MyFitnessPal Story, pg 90
> **Mike Lee** *Cofounder and CEO*

In 2013, as we jumped from 10 to 30 people, I assumed we'd become 200% more productive.  I'd underestimated how much scaling can slow you down. New engineers need extensive training before they can be as proficient as your holdovers. And with multiple engineers developing the same project, we had to build new processes to keep them from overriding one another. In the transition, productivity took a hit.

Alignment doesn't mean redundancy. At MyFitnessPal, every OKR has a single owner. Co-ownership weakens accountability. If an OKR fails, you don't want 2 people blaming each other.

When the company was acquired by Under Armour. First, we had to define our capacity constraints. Then we had to clarify our core priorities.  People began to recognize our limits and adjust their expectations accordingly.
