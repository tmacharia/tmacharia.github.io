### 6. Commit: The Nuna Story, pg 69
> **Jini Kim** *Cofounder and CEO*

When we still had no orders in year two, I knew it was time to get an education. What did meaningful innovation look like in the health care market? I put on a suit and crashed some human resources conferences to find out.

To inspire true commitment, leaders must practise what they teach. They must model the behaviour they expect of others.

By definition, startups wrestle with ambiguity. Therefore, the whole team needs sharper focus and clearer priorities, the prerequisites for deeper commitment.

Most of all, we want the Nuna platform to play a big role in improving the nation's health care. It's a daunting commitment. But as I learned at Google: The hairier the mission, the more important your OKRs.

### 7. Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork, pg 77
> We don't hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.
> &mdash; <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

According to the *Harvard Business Review*, companies with highly aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top performers.

.. And it's really hard for employees to see what they should work on first. Everything seems important; everything seems urgent. But what *really* needs to get done? The answer lies in focused, transparent OKRs. They knit each individual's work to team efforts, departmental projects, and the overall mission.

For the org chart in pg. 84, Now, what's wrong with this picture? Here's a clue. The SVPs key results are a mess. Unlike the head coach's KRs, they're unmeasurable. They're not specific or time bound.
When objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects:
* *A loss of agility*
* *A lack of flexibility*
* *Marginalized contributors*
* *One-dimensional linkages*

Fortunately, there's an alternative, **Bottoms Up!**. The antithesis of cascading might be Google's "20 percent time", which frees engineers to work on side projects for the equivalent of one day per week.
People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there.
**Cross-functional Coordination**

### 8. Align: The MyFitnessPal Story, pg 90
> **Mike Lee** *Cofounder and CEO*

In 2013, as we jumped from 10 to 30 people, I assumed we'd become 200% more productive.  I'd underestimated how much scaling can slow you down. New engineers need extensive training before they can be as proficient as your holdovers. And with multiple engineers developing the same project, we had to build new processes to keep them from overriding one another. In the transition, productivity took a hit.

Alignment doesn't mean redundancy. At MyFitnessPal, every OKR has a single owner. Co-ownership weakens accountability. If an OKR fails, you don't want 2 people blaming each other.

When the company was acquired by Under Armour. First, we had to define our capacity constraints. Then we had to clarify our core priorities.  People began to recognize our limits and adjust their expectations accordingly. 

### 9. Connect: The Intuit Story, pg 102
> **Atticus Tysen** *Chief Information Officer*

Modern IT goes way beyond checking off boxes to process help tickets or change requests. It's about adding *value* to the business, shedding redundant clone systems, creating new functionality, finding future-oriented solutions.

### 10. Superpower #3: Track for Accountability, pg 113
> In God we trust; all others must bring data.
> &mdash; <cite>W. Edwards Deming</cite>

OKRs, their life cycle unfolds in three phases:
* The Setup
* Midlife Tracking
* Wrap-up: Rinse and Repeat

**The Setup**

In 2014, when Bill Pence came to AOL as global CTO, .. Pence says. Without frequent status updates, goals slide into irrelevance; the gap between plan and reality widens by the day.
Its good to have a cloud based OKR system for transparency & real time feedback.
To avoid resistance, designating OKR shepherds would be ideal.

**Midlife Tracking**

As the Fitbit craze attests, people crave to know how they are progressing and see it visually represented, down to the percentage point. 

As we track and audit our OKRs, we have four options at any point in the cycle:
* *Continue* - goal isn't broken, don't fix it.
* *Update* - modify a yellow zone "needs attention" to get the goal on track.
* *Start* - launch a new OKR mid-cycle.
* *Stop* - a red zone "at risk", goal has outlived its usefulness, maybe drop it.

**Wrap-up: Rinse and Repeat**

*Scoring*

The simplest, cleanest way to score an objective is by averaging the percentage completion rates of its associated key results. Google uses a scale of 0 to 1.0:
* 0.7 to 1.0 = green.* (We delivered)
* 0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress but fell short)
* 0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress)

*Self-assessment*

In evaluating OKR perfomance, objective data is enhanced by the goal setter's thoughtful, subjective judgement.

*Reflection*

The philosopher and educator John Dewey said, "We  do not learn from experience...we learn from reflecting on experience".
OKR wrap-ups are retrospective and forward-looking at the same time.

### 11. Track: The Gates Foundation Story, pg 126
> **Bill Gates** *Cochairman*
> **Patty Stonesifer** *Former CEO*

There were two cases where I turned down a grant in the end because the goals weren't clear enough.
When a goal is too aspirational, it's bad for credibility.

Courtesy of the Gates Foundation, the Guinea worm disease, *Dracunculiasis*, its scientific name, is now expected to become the second disease in human history to be eradicated, after smallpox which was eradicated in 1980. In 2015, the number of reported cases was 22.

According to *Patty Stonesifer*, setting the big goals wasn't as hard as breaking them down: What rocks need to moved to achieve them?

Case in point: the ongoing fight against the most lethal animal on the planet, the mosquito. Driven by empirical data, focus has been shifted from a transmission-blocking vaccine to a comprehensive eradication strategy.

Objective: **Global eradication of malaria by 2040**

*Key Results*
1. Prove to the world that a radical cure-based approach can lead to regional elimination.
2. Prepare for scale-up by creating the necessary tools&mdash;SERCAP (Single Exposure Radical Cure and Prophylaxis) Diagnostic.
3. Sustain current global progress to ensure the environment is conducive to eradication push.
